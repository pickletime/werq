Aurora:
1.0 - 1/8/18:
release version. 
1.1 - 2/26/18:
It now only prints text if there was something to do. I could make it much faster by including everything in the loop, but i can't be bothered to so do.
1.2 - 4/27/18
I found that the barcode renaming was misbehaving, so i added a test before renumbering.
